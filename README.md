Growing from a simple SFML trial prototype created for a) learning the lib,
b) learning how to architect visual sims (and games) around frame-based
low-level graphics, c) hopefully distilling a simple framework/toolkit for
developing apps that need this sort of foundations, d) even more vaguely:
perhaps actually developing something interesting out of it -- now it's
gradually becoming an engine + its first (test) app (a minimalist cosmic
simulation toy, or maybe even a minimalist world-building game later).

Even though its presentation is still offensively crude (unsurprisingly,
for a prototype), and its features/controls very limited -- basically just
a single steerable body that can spawn free-floating other bodies (in various
configurations), plus "metaphysical" manipulation of the fundamental constants
of its simplified Newtonian physics -- it's already complex enough to produce
an endless flow of rich semi-chaotic emergent formations, and to inspire
fascinating ideas.

...Which I'm chock-full of already, and can hardly wait to get through (the
mountains of) some boring/daunting architectural design + low-level tech
hurdles first, and start crafting the fun bits. You can't wait! ;)

occasionally, however, they can't convey the fist-hand experience of actually
manipulating the wolrd, or even just watching the mesmerizing flow and constant
development of interesting superstructures -- just like in the real universe.)_
