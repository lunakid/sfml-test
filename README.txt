How the fuck is the static-built exe a) so small, b) EVEN SMALLER THAN THE DLL BUILD?!
(Yes, it really is static: renamed sfml/bin and it still ran fine.)

TODO:

- FPS HUD
	+ debug console log on/off, and check how it affects the fps!
- separate UI thread + check if window drag/resize would still block...
- measure FPS without full screen clear + redraw
- text on T400 + Win7
- remove SFML dependencies from the World!
