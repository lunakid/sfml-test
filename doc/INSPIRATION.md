Colossal Cave Adventure
	Prime example how a minimalist presentation doesn't matter if there's
	a vast, permanent, (more-or-less) simulated ("real") world to explore!

Thrust
	For the lovely mechanics, its simplistic mission/challenge approach,
	and of course the ultimate minimalist presentation. Another nice example
	of high entertainment value "despite...".

No Man's Sky
	I honestly have 0 idea whatsoever about the specifics of this game.
	I've only seen a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/6umfoe/help_stranded_on_a_dead_planet/) with someone asking for help in a
	pretty uninspiring situation, and I haven't even read any of the answers
	there -- but I've received strong meta signals telling me what to do... ;)
	Also as a reminder of Elite... ;)

Elite
	The (almost) original one, from the C64... Not the trading, but the
	exploration, again: "despite"... And the interactions. And the missions,
	that there are goals to pursue.
	Oh, and such powerful ideas as "collecting free-floating cargo canisters
	and escape capsules liberated after the destruction of other ships"... :)
