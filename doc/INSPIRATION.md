Cellular automata

  Conway's Game of Life has given us the visceral presentation of the
  fundamental piece of knowledge that everything emerges from basically
  nothing...

Universal Paperclip

  The (again) _visceral_ experience of ("univerasal") scales, and how the
  positive feedback loop of exponential growth will kill us (before we could
  notice, let alone do anything whatsoever about it).
  And that fancy looks, or even complex gameplay, doesn't matter at all,
  if the core concepts are right. Feeling the truth is powerful.

Colossal Cave Adventure

  Classic, prime example how a crude presentation doesn't matter if there's
  a vast, permanent, (more-or-less) simulated ("real") world to explore.
  An adventure _itself_ can be immersive enough, evoking chill and excitement
  without "spelling out" every bit of the expertience.
  Moreover, _hidihg_ things, that are also to be found, can be an exciting
  adventure all by itself. Untangling mysteries is powerful.

Thrust

  For its lovely mechanics, its simplistic mission/challenge approach,
  and of course its fearlessly minimalist presentation. Another nice example
  of high entertainment value "despite...".

Minecraft

  Never actually played it, but I did play with Legos a lot. :)
  It's, of course, the same core thrill of building, creating complex
  things, especially when managing from the simplest of elements.

No Man's Sky

  I honestly have 0 idea whatsoever about the specifics of this game.
  I've only seen a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/6umfoe/help_stranded_on_a_dead_planet/) with someone asking for help in a
  pretty uninspiring situation, and I haven't even read any of the answers
  there -- but I've received strong meta signals, whispering what to do! :)
  Also, as a reminder of Elite...

Elite

  (The (almost) original one, from the C64.) Not the trading, but the
  exploration, also of a vast space, and again: "despite"... And the early
  lessons of interactions, tasks, missions, that there are goals to pursue,
  and there are others out there.
  Oh, and such powerful ideas as "collecting free-floating cargo canisters
  and escape capsules liberated after the destruction of other ships"... :)

Dwarf Fortress

  OMG, what a lovely hackfest of a world sim! :) Never actually played it,
  but what I've seen has enough radiation to make me feel inspired whenever
  I even just think of it. I don't even know any of the details, but still...
  And it's partly exactly that: the myth around it. And the sheer magnitude
  of the effort, dedication etc. Oh, and all that with basically no graphics!

RDR1

  Their love for the world they've created, and their passion for detail...
  They had proper lip sync, gestures, body movement and all, even by 2010,
  and that doesn't even begin to describe the level of accuracy. They didn't
  even care how much of it the player can actually experience. There are
  mods dedicated to emphasizing features you basically can't even really
  notice in the original, let alone enjoy... (It's super high-tech though,
  so that must be considered when trying to learn from it.)

The Witness

  The aura of mystery and exploration (again...). And those lustful colors,
  and sunshine, and greenery, and the atmosphere of some of the scenery...
  Orsi Spanyol, and Mr. Blow & the others, great job! :) Also, the general
  attention to detail, and the correctness of how things work (and are
  implemented). Note: not sure how much of that applies here, but the appeal
  of the game -- again -- doesn't come from any high-end tech. It's <2015
  tech anyway. (And it appeal certainly doesn't come from its Zen Buddhist
  diatribes either, BTW. :) )

Nature, IRL...

  Well of course. You don't need a game or a story to be constantly in awe
  just be existing, honestly...
