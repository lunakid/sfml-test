Cellular automata

  Conway's Game of Life has given us the visceral presentation of the
  fundamental piece of knowledge that everything emerges from basically
  nothing...

Universal Paperclip

  The (again) _visceral_ experience of ("univerasal") scales, and how the
  positive feedback loop of exponential growth will kill us (before we could
  notice, let alone do anything whatsoever about it).
  And that fancy looks, or even complex gameplay, doesn't matter at all,
  if the core concepts are right. Feeling the truth is powerful.

Colossal Cave Adventure

  Classic, prime example how a crude presentation doesn't matter if there's
  a vast, permanent, (more-or-less) simulated ("real") world to explore.
  An adventure _itself_ can be immersive enough, evoking chill and excitement
  without "spelling out" every bit of the expertience.
  Moreover, _hidihg_ things, that are also to be found, can be an exciting
  adventure all by itself. Untangling mysteries is powerful.

Thrust

  For its lovely mechanics, its simplistic mission/challenge approach,
  and of course its fearlessly minimalist presentation. Another nice example
  of high entertainment value "despite...".

Minecraft

  Never actually played it, but I did play with Legos a lot. :)
  It's, of course, the same core thrill of building, creating complex
  things, especially when managing from the simplest of elements.

No Man's Sky

  I honestly have 0 idea whatsoever about the specifics of this game.
  I've only seen a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/6umfoe/help_stranded_on_a_dead_planet/) with someone asking for help in a
  pretty uninspiring situation, and I haven't even read any of the answers
  there -- but I've received strong meta signals telling me what to do. :)
  Also as a reminder of Elite... ;)

Elite

  (The (almost) original one, from the C64.) Not the trading, but the
  exploration, also of a vast space, and again: "despite"... And the early
  lessons of interactions, tasks, missions, that there are goals to pursue,
  and there are others out there.
  Oh, and such powerful ideas as "collecting free-floating cargo canisters
  and escape capsules liberated after the destruction of other ships"... :)

Nature

  Of course. You don't need a game/toy/story to be constantly in awe.
