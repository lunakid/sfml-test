Gameplay elements to not miss:

- Nice big explosions :)
- Fast-moving objects
- Fast-moving me...
- Drawing with exhaust particle tails
- Shooting out ejecta jets
- An active, living system elongating and sucking up that exhaust tail
  in a nice curve

- Ejecta from a high-speed collision (esp. when a small body hits a big one)

- Strange, complex, transient formations
- Strange, complex, sustained formations (even better, of course)

- Escaping the strong pull some other ("hostile") object/system
- Escaping the strong pull of a *friendly* object/system... (inadvertent
  damage "out of love" :) -> friendly fire)
