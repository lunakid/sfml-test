Utilities closely related to the current implementation language

Note: Nothing here is allowed to invoke anything outside of this dir,
      as an arbitrary encapsulation rule hereby proclaimed...

(Extra utilities (beyond ground-levelling), which are "markedly"
specific to the implementation language (i.e. things that make no
sense for implementations in other languages) should go to an `ext`
subfolder. Can't decide yet... Needs longer-term test-driving.)
