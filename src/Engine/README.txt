Sim./modeling/game/... engine lib/framework

Still a prototype, with missing and unclear scope/interfaces/services (e.g. this
is mostly just a system/backend/foundations + UI + app logic/controller layer,
with no support for rendering or physics/modeling (TBD!)), but slowly graduating
to be useful/usable on its own, nonetheless.

As things mature and generalize, they should percolate here, while the specific
app layer should melt ever thinner, draining its weight (generics) here.
